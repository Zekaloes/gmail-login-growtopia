How to Use:
1.Download both the folder and gmail.exe.

2.Move both the folder and gmail.exe to your Lucifer folder.

3.Open Lucifer, go to settings, and check 'Use WebDriver'.

Now, when you add a Gmail bot, it will automatically open a browser and log in to your email.

How to Make It Support G Suite Email (myemail@domain.com):
